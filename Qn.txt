Shopping Cart 1
In the next 8 questions we are going to build a Shopping Cart. The HTML and the CSS code is already written, you only have to add to the JavaScript code.

You have been given an array named “productslist” which contains a list of products with all the necessary details about the product.

You have been given some starter code in the js file , you have to add new code to the existing file.

Our first task is to display all the products in the “productslist” array. You are given a HTML code which you will insert into the page using Javascript.

Map over the “productslist” array and add the following HTML for each element in the div with class=”productscontainer”.


<div class="product">
<img class='pimage' width="250px" height="350px" src=" ${e.image} "
alt="">
<p class='ptitle'>${e.title}</p>
<div class="priceandaddtocart">
<p class="pprice">${e.price} DH</p>
<button class="addtocart" productid=${e.id}>add to cart icon</button>
</div>
</div>


QN 2 ===============----------------------------------------------------------------
Shopping Cart 2
In continuation with shopping cart 1 , in this question we will add the toggle feature to the cart, to display and hide the cart items.

You have to do the following things to pass all the test cases-



Select the div with class=”carticon”. Add an onclick event handler on it which adds a “cartopened” class to the div with class=”cartui”. This shows the cart items when div with class=”carticon” is clicked.


Now to hide the cart, select the div with class=”closecart” and add an onclick event handler to it. The event handler removes the “cartopened” class from the div with class=”cartui”.

QN 3 ===============----------------------------------------------------------------

QN 5 ----------------------------------------------------------------
Shopping Cart 5
In continuation with shopping cart 4, in this question we are going to make the cart UI.

Implement the following steps to pass all the test cases-



Create a class named Ui which contains two methods.


The first function “displayproducts” takes in a product as an argument and adds it to the existing list of products


The “displayproducts” function inserts HTML inside the div with class=pccontainer


The HTML it inserts is




<div class="cartproduct">
<div class="pnp">
<div class="img">
<img width="90px" src=" ${e.image} " alt="">
</div>
<div class="nameandprice">
<p> ${e.title} </p>
<p> ${e.price} </p>
</div>
</div>

<button class="delete" productid=${e.id}>
X
</button>
</div>




make the “displayproducts” function static


Create another static function named “displayproductsLS” which displays the list of items already present in the cart and is stored in the local storage


Use the “Storage” class to get the list of items already present in the cart and for each element insert the given HTML inside the div with class=”pccontainer”




<div class="cartproduct">
<div class="pnp">
<div class="img">
<img width="90px" src=" ${e.image} " alt="">
