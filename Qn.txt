Shopping Cart 1
In the next 8 questions we are going to build a Shopping Cart. The HTML and the CSS code is already written, you only have to add to the JavaScript code.

You have been given an array named “productslist” which contains a list of products with all the necessary details about the product.

You have been given some starter code in the js file , you have to add new code to the existing file.

Our first task is to display all the products in the “productslist” array. You are given a HTML code which you will insert into the page using Javascript.

Map over the “productslist” array and add the following HTML for each element in the div with class=”productscontainer”.


<div class="product">
<img class='pimage' width="250px" height="350px" src=" ${e.image} "
alt="">
<p class='ptitle'>${e.title}</p>
<div class="priceandaddtocart">
<p class="pprice">${e.price} DH</p>
<button class="addtocart" productid=${e.id}>add to cart icon</button>
</div>
</div>
