Shopping Cart 1
In the next 8 questions we are going to build a Shopping Cart. The HTML and the CSS code is already written, you only have to add to the JavaScript code.

You have been given an array named “productslist” which contains a list of products with all the necessary details about the product.

You have been given some starter code in the js file , you have to add new code to the existing file.

Our first task is to display all the products in the “productslist” array. You are given a HTML code which you will insert into the page using Javascript.

Map over the “productslist” array and add the following HTML for each element in the div with class=”productscontainer”.


<div class="product">
<img class='pimage' width="250px" height="350px" src=" ${e.image} "
alt="">
<p class='ptitle'>${e.title}</p>
<div class="priceandaddtocart">
<p class="pprice">${e.price} DH</p>
<button class="addtocart" productid=${e.id}>add to cart icon</button>
</div>
</div>


QN 2
Shopping Cart 2
In continuation with shopping cart 1 , in this question we will add the toggle feature to the cart, to display and hide the cart items.

You have to do the following things to pass all the test cases-



Select the div with class=”carticon”. Add an onclick event handler on it which adds a “cartopened” class to the div with class=”cartui”. This shows the cart items when div with class=”carticon” is clicked.


Now to hide the cart, select the div with class=”closecart” and add an onclick event handler to it. The event handler removes the “cartopened” class from the div with class=”cartui”.
